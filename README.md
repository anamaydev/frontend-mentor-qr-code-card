## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned
During this HTML/CSS challenge, I learned some really cool things that will come in handy for future web design projects. For example, I now know how to center a div using flex box, which is a powerful tool for creating awesome layouts. I also picked up some tricks for positioning images in a way that makes them look super cool and eye-catching. Overall, I'm feeling pretty proud of myself for picking up these new skills, and I'm excited to see how I can use them to make some seriously awesome websites!
